## Cursor Landing Page Clone (HTML + CSS)

This project is a desktop-first visual clone of the Cursor landing page, built using only HTML and CSS.

The goal of this assignment was to closely match Cursor’s layout, spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy — without adding animations, JavaScript, or frameworks.
